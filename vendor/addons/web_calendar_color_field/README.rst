This is a technical module. It doesn't do anything on its own.

Odoo introduced a mechanism to set the desired color for a calendar filter,
through the field's `color` attribute.

Unfortunately, this only works for filters, but not if we want to use the
calendar's `color` attribute.

This module makes the appropiate changes so that the filter's color is used, if available.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

Set a color attribute value on any many2one calendar field set as filter and
set the calendar's color attribute to use the same many2one field.

Example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <calendar color="category_id">
        <field name="category_id" filter="1" color="kanban_color"/>
    </calendar>

- `category_id` is a `Many2one` field in your record.
- `kanban_color` is an integer field in your category record.
