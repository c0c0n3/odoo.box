# NOTE
# ----
# 1. wkhtmltopdf. See (1) in `wkhtmltopdf.nix`.
#
# 2. Source. Why not fetch from GitHub? Because the tarball consolidates
# all the add-ons in the `odoo/addons` dir whereas the repo has them split
# in two dirs: `repo/addons` and `repo/odoo/addons`. If you run the server
# from the repo you'll have to pass the path to the other addons dir since
# some of the modules the code in `repo/odoo` expects are actually in the
# `repo/addons` dir.
#
# 3. Gevent server. We've got to patch the source to fix an issue with
# the gevent server Odoo uses for long-polling/chat. The problem is that
# the code to spawn the server blindly assumes the command line to start
# Odoo was in the format `python odoo ...`, but this may not be true in
# general since a quite common thing to do is to actually use a shell start
# script. The problem boils down to line 713 in `odoo/service/server.py`
# where `long_polling_spawn` starts the gevent process with this command:
#
#     cmd = [sys.executable, sys.argv[0], 'gevent'] + nargs[1:]
#
# So if you used a start script `my-odoo`, Odoo would try running a
# command like `python my-odoo ...` which would fail unless `my-odoo`
# is Python code. This is exactly the case for our Nix package where
# a shell script called `odoo` nicely sets up the server env before
# actually invoking Python on yet another Nix wrapper script, called
# `.odoo-wrapped`, which is a Python script that sets up the Python
# lib path before finally calling `odoo.cli.main`. Long story short,
# changing the Python line above into the one below makes Odoo start
# cleanly and spawn the gevent process as expected.
#
#     cmd = [sys.argv[0], 'gevent'] + nargs[1:]
#
# See `server.py.patch`.
#
# 4. Broken tests. Some tests are broken, so we've got to skip testing.
#
# 5.Stripping. The Odoo 15 package skips stripping, claiming it takes 5+
# minutes and there are no files to strip. So we do the same.
