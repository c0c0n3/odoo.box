#
# Poetry project to manage Odoo's deps with Poetry.
#
# To put together this file and the corresponding lock file from scratch:
# - start our Nix shell
# - download `odoo_14.0.20231205.tar.gz`
# - extract and `cd` into extracted dir
# - run `poetry init`
# - edit generated `pyproject.toml` to change the `packages` include
#   to `odoo` and copy over Python deps from `requirements.txt`
# - run `poetry lock`
# - copy over both `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` to our Odoo
#   Nix package source dir
#
