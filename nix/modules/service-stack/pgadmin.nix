# NOTE
# ----
# 1. Why not use NixOS's built-in PgAdmin module? Race conditions.
# The NixOS module bootstraps the PgAdmin DB with a procedure that
# won't work reliably in our case where we use Postgres as a PgAdmin
# config DB instead of the built-in SQLite backend. Now the command
# we and the NixOS module use to bootstrap the PgAdmin DB is the
# `pgadmin4-setup` Python script from the `pgadmin4` Nix package.
# This script won't create a Postgres DB, so we've got to create
# one before the script runs. But to do that, Postgres must be up
# and running, which won't necessarily be the case when the NixOS
# PgAdmin module's systemd `ExecStartPre` fires. Indeed, while the
# systemd docs explicitly state
# > ExecStartPost= is taken into account for the purpose of
# > Before=/After= ordering constraints
# there's no mention of `ExecStartPre` and ordering constraints.
# To prove the point, we tweaked the NixOS PgAdmin module to make
# PgAdmin start after Postgres:
#
#     systemd.services.pgadmin.after = [ "postgresql.service" ];
#     systemd.services.pgadmin.requires = [ "postgresql.service" ];
#
# and created the PgAdmin DB through a script executed in the
# `ExecStartPost` of the Postgres systemd service. Sure as hell,
# every now and then the `pgadmin4-setup` script running as part
# of `ExecStartPre` in the PgAdmin service failed b/c the PgAdmin
# DB wasn't there.
# Long story short: the PgAdmin DB bootstrap should be done as
# a separate systemd service scheduled to run after Postgres but
# before PgAdmin. This seems the only sane way to avoid race
# conditions. So that's what we do.
#
# 2. Service synchronisation. We need systemd to wait until the
# bootstrap script has completed. If it doesn't then you could
# get into a race condition where the bootstrap procedure runs
# concurrently with the PgAdmin UI which will also try creating
# tables and populating the DB---it uses the same setup module
# as `pgadmin4-setup`. To prevent that, we make our setup service
# a systemd "notify" service. This kind of service waits until it
# receives a "ready" notification from the called command. Our
# `pgadmin-boot` command actually uses `systemd-notify` to send
# that signal after the whole bootstrap procedure has completed
# successfully.
#
# 3. DB junk. See:
# - https://github.com/c0c0n3/odoo.box/issues/14
#
# 4. Possibly simpler bootstrap procedure. See:
# - https://github.com/c0c0n3/odoo.box/issues/15
