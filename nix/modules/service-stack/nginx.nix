# NOTE
# ----
# 1. Proxing PgAdmin. Our setup is conceptually the same as the one
# the PgAdmin docs recommend, but not exactly the same in terms of
# implementation. We skip `include proxy_params` since we already
# turned on `recommendedProxySettings` for the whole server. Plus,
# traffic is over the loopback interface instead of a Unix socket.
# Same same but different.
