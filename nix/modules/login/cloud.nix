# NOTE
# ----
# 1. Disabling admin and root password login. This works because no
# hashed password will ever match "!", so these users won't be able
# to log in with a password.
# See:
# - https://discourse.nixos.org/t/how-to-disable-root-user-account-in-configuration-nix/13235
#
# 2. Lockout sanity check. If there's no SSH keys, then you get locked
# out of the target machine. This is because we set bogus passwords (1)
# and so there's no way you can get in without an SSH key. Now NixOS
# has a similar sanity check where it stops evaluation if it detects
# a lockout situation and warns you about with the following message:
# > Neither the root account nor any wheel user has a password
# > or SSH authorized key. You must set one to prevent being
# > locked out of your system.
# But b/c we set a password, the built-in NixOS check won't work for
# us.
